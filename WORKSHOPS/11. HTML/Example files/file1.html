        <b>This</b> is what bold looks like.

    <!-- Notice above how the <b> element is nested within the <p> element. Notice how we use indentation when
		nesting elements to make our code easier to read. -->
    <p>This is an example of

<!-- Some things to note:
1) The indenting makes no difference to the meaning of the code above - it makes it easier to read and know what elements fall under which other elements, i.e. if a paragraph relates to heading 1 or 2.
	
2) The opening and closing of tags, and how they are nested correctly.
	
3) The basic elements - p, h(number 1-6), b, em -->
